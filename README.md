To make the book as a PDF file, you must have LaTeX installed on your computer.  Assuming a Unix-based system, you should be able to simply type 'make' and it will make the PDF.

Before committing anything to GitHub or storing a distribution or anything like that, you should probably type 'make veryclean'.  This is to remove the various files that LaTeX generates.
